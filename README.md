# Type_2_Diabetes_Prediction
Machine Learning module project

Dataset and analysis 
- Dataset: UKbiobank
- Idea: Type 2 Diabetes prediction
- Run at least two supervised and one unsupervised algorithm. (the unsupervised algorithm can be used to give a descriptive overview of the data. the supervised algorithms should be at least two to compare results.) 


Possible aims to consider:
- Build a classficiation model to predict type 2 diabetes.
- Identifying the most important features for type 2 diabetes prediction 
- Develop a risk prediction model to estimate the likelihood of type 2 diabetes in a patient. 

Steps 
- data extraction 
- data cleaning, splitting 
- imputation, matching
- reduce dimensionality if needed 
- clustering 
- modelling 
- validation 
- stability analysis and sensitivity analysis

project presentation 
- 02/05/2023 
- Keep the code tidy
- 1-3 slides of background, 1-5 slides of methods including data description, pre-processing, model tuning, up to 10 slides of results, 1 slide for conclusions/future work (no discussion or public recommendations are needed). Try to keep the total around 15 slides.

Various
- It is ok to apply new methods to an existing paper/study in order to improve it

Rubric 
- Clear and concise presentation of the rationale and question you chose
- Justification of methods chosen and detailed knowledge of both theory and best practices for each method (e.g. data processing required, parameter tuning etc.)
- Clear presentation of the results and appropriate comparison metrics
- Appropriate choice of visuals i.e. plots, tables, diagrams etc.
- Confident conclusions
